# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

Build a quiz made up of several multiple choice questions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The final product should allow you to press a 'Start Button' on the landing page to begin the quiz and allow you to cycle through as you respond to each question. Pressing the 'Start Button' will also start a timer which counts down from 75 seconds. The quiz ends when all the questions are answered or when the timer runs out. 

## Overview of Work Done

* Webpage built using HTML and styled using CSS

* Title page, quiz description, and functional 'Start Button' aligned centrally towards the top of the page.

* 'Start Button' clears the landing page and starts the quiz with the first question.

* Upon starting the quiz, timer in the top right counts down from 50. If a question is answered incorrectly then the timer reduces by an additional 5 seconds.

* Score is measured by the amount of seconds left on the timer after the last question has been answered.

* Quiz is over when all questions are answer or the timer hits zero. If a high score has been achieved, the user will be prompted to input their initials and save their score to local storage. If they did not get a high score, they will be told their final score and prompted to refresh the page to play again.
